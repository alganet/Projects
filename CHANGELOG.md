## 2015-07-26 Prototype

### Added
  - A silly README.md with compiler samples only (c'mon this is
    early stage!)

### Changed
  - Made commands and parser much more stable. Now they can handle
    multiple nested annotations and unnamed special annotations (not
    sure I'm going to remember what those are since names are
    changing so fast! =D)
  - Fence closing improvements for empty fences.

## 2015-07-25 Prototype

### Added
  - Some documentation and history for each prototype.
  - This very own CHANGELOG.

### Changed

  - Overall refactoring.
